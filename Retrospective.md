## Experience

This was so troublesome. Firstly, I didn't realise there was a reading so I had to do that so I could understand everything. Then my pug just didnt show up when I went to local host so I couldn't even tell if anything was working and I had tried to figure that out for a bit. After that I just went to an online pug renderer and used that and I was able to see my file and thus edits. Then it became a bit easier to write the html out and convert it.

## Known issues or Bugs

The pug doesnt load into the browser on vscode so I had to use an online renderer and then everything worked. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I tried to fix this for a few hours and I still have no clue what is wrong with my machine.
